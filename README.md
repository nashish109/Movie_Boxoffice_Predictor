# Movie Box Office Predictor
This project explores how data can be used to predict a movieâ€™s box office performance. It takes in historical movie data, cleans and analyzes it, and then builds a simple machine learning model to estimate revenue. Along the way, it also creates helpful visualizations and a summary report to make the insights easier to understand.
